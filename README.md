# PyTorch Multi-Class Synthetic Data Generator & Visualizer

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to generate synthetic multi-class data using PyTorch and visualize it using matplotlib. It includes code to create synthetic data, convert it into PyTorch tensors, split it into training and testing sets, and plot the data for visualization.

## Features
- Generates synthetic multi-class data using PyTorch.
- Converts data into PyTorch tensors.
- Splits data into training and testing sets.
- Visualizes the data using matplotlib.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

## Requirements
- Python 3.11.5
- PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/shivam-nath-10003/MultiClassSyntheticData.git
    ```


2. Alternatively, you can explore the analysis and visualization in the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```
    jupyter notebook Multi_classification_pytorch.ipynb
    ```
